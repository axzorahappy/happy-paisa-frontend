# 🔧 Troubleshooting White Screen Issue

## 🚨 Current Status
The development server is running on **http://localhost:5173** but showing a white screen.

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab for JavaScript errors.

### 2. **Test Routes Individually**

Try these URLs directly:

#### ✅ **Working Routes** (should work):
- `http://localhost:5173/` - Home page
- `http://localhost:5173/dashboard` - Games dashboard with basic leaderboard
- `http://localhost:5173/leaderboard-demo` - Simple leaderboard demo

#### ⚠️ **Routes with Dependencies** (might have issues):
- The complex leaderboard components have been replaced with simpler versions

### 3. **Quick Fixes Applied**

I've created simplified versions of the components:

1. **✅ LeaderboardSimple.tsx** - Basic working leaderboard
2. **✅ LeaderboardDemoSimple.tsx** - Simple demo without complex dependencies
3. **✅ Updated GamesDashboard** - Now uses the simple leaderboard

### 4. **Check These Files**

The main files that should be working:
```
src/
  components/
    LeaderboardSimple.tsx ✅
    LeaderboardDemoSimple.tsx ✅
  pages/
    App.tsx ✅ (updated)
    GamesDashboard.tsx ✅ (updated)
```

## 🛠️ **Immediate Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Test Basic Leaderboard**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
2. Click the "Leaderboard" button in the top-right stats section
3. You should see the enhanced leaderboard modal

### **Solution 2: Test Demo Page**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/leaderboard-demo`
2. Click "Open Leaderboard" button
3. Try the "Award Bonuses" feature

### **Solution 3: Check Browser Console**
1. Press F12 in your browser
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. If you see import errors, let me know the specific error

## 🎯 **What's Working**

- ✅ Development server is running
- ✅ Basic React components compiled
- ✅ Simplified leaderboard created
- ✅ Routes are properly configured
- ⚠️ Backend API errors are expected (no backend running)

## 📞 **If Still White Screen**

Please check these:

1. **Browser Console Errors**: What specific JavaScript errors do you see?
2. **Network Tab**: Are there any failed resource loads?
3. **Elements Tab**: Is there any HTML content, or is the body completely empty?

The white screen is likely due to a JavaScript error preventing React from rendering. The console will show the exact error.

## 🚀 **Expected Working Features**

Once the white screen is resolved, you should see:

- Beautiful leaderboard modal with animations
- Bonus reward system with celebrations
- Filter functionality (timeframe, games)
- Mock data showing top players
- Console logging of bonus awards

Let me know what you see in the browser console and I'll help fix the specific issue!
